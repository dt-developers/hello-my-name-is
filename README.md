# System Requirements

Tested on Raspberry Pi 400, known to not working on MacOS (bluez not installable).

# Usage

> ./hello
> help
> start

The user comes to an attached screen, sees random images and is able to just print a badge, after entering a name and a number. The number references a predermined array of emoji or image pathes, and renderes them at the bottom center of the badge. This image / emoji is of great use for team building, and converstation starters.

Please feel free to read through the screen text to find out more what it can do.
